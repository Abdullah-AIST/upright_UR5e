# Mobile Manipulator Pybullet Simulation

Mobile manipulator simulation environment using Pybullet.

## Installation

The Python environment is managed with
[pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Clone this repo and then, inside
the repo's root directory, run `pipenv install` to install the required
packages in a new virtual environment. Then run `pipenv shell` to start a new
subshell in that environment (i.e. for running the simulation).

## Usage

python simulation.py
```

## Development

Code should be formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
