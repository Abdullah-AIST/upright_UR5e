# Upright: ROS interface

Interface with ROS. ROS is used for any inter-process communication tasks,
either between computers (e.g. workstation and a robot) or between different
processes on a single computer (e.g. a slow outer-loop MPC and a fast
inner-loop controller).

For now, we are focused mainly on the arm without the base.

## Run
